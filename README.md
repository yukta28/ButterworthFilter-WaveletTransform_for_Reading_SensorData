# ButterworthFilter-WaveletTransform_for_Reading_SensorData
A Butterworth filter is defined as a maximally flat filter that provides the sharpest roll-off possible without inducing peaking in the Bode plot. It is commonly used in control systems due to its lack of peaking, making it a natural choice for organizing poles in higher-order filters.
